# Covid--19-Project_SQL_Queries
Exploring Covid-19 Vaccination Rates Globally

This project will try to answer some of the following questions:

1. Total Covd-19 Cases vs Total Deaths Globally
2. Highest Infection Rates Globally
3. Vaccination Rates Globally

The project could be also done using Python language, however, SQL was used preferred for this project. In addition, active dashboards are also developed using Tableau, from tables produced using SQL in SQL Server Management Studio. The link to Tableau dashboards is provided in the Links section of this dcoument.
